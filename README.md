## What is TC
Who never wanted to give a file to a friend and needed to put it in a cloud to share and at the end delete from there? Well, TC is the solution to this problem. For one hour you can share a file with anyone you want to, and at the end of the time, it will be deleted automatically.

## Quickstart
To have your own Temp Cloud you will gonna need [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org).<br>
Clone/Download this repository and inside them run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

After that you only need to run:

    flask run

Now, you can go to [**127.0.0.1:5000**](http://127.0.0.1:5000), and enjoy your TC.
